<h1>My Vacation to Destin, Florida</h1>
<p>We got up early in the morning to get ready for the vacation in Destin, Florida. We ate breakfast and packed everything into the car. Someone forget something, so we had to go back home and get it. After that, we were back on the road. During the trip to Destin we made stops along the way. Most of the stops were for restroom breaks and food. However, my sister wanted a figurine, so we stopped and looked for one.</p>

<p>We finally made it in Destin late in the afternoon. We checked in at the front desk and put our luggage in our hotel room. After that we rested for a few hours and then went to a restaurant. The food at the restaurant we went to was good. The restaurant also had a bowling alley in it. After we ate we went back to the hotel and everyone went to sleep or stayed up for a little bit.</p>

<p>The next day we went to the beach. We brought out some beach chairs since there was only two and there was four of us. We also brought out some beach toys, towels, and boogie boards. After we got all the things we wanted to bring out on the beach, we went to the beach. When we arrived, we saw that the waves were a little choppy. They were not calm, but they also were not really rough.</p>

<p>I went out into the water to get acclimated to the water temperature. After that I got my boogie board and begin riding the waves. It was funny riding the waves. The only thing that was not fun was when I got water in my face. The water tasted like salt every time I got it in my mouth. After being at the beach for a while we left and went back to our hotel room.</p>

<p>We all took showers and put on some different clothes. We went to another restaurant and the food was not that good. I did not like the restaurant because it did not suit my preference. I think it was an Italian restaurant. I do not like Italian because it is mainly pasta and I prefer to eat meat with pasta.</p>
